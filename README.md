# Bank_DL
Bank Marketing Prediction

This project predicts whether a customer will subscribe to a bank product using demographic, financial, and campaign data. It includes data exploration, preprocessing, and a deep learning model.

Features

Data Exploration: Analyze distributions, correlations, and missing values for numeric and categorical features.

Preprocessing: Encode the target, one-hot encode categorical features, scale numeric features, and split into training/testing sets.

Deep Learning Model: Sequential neural network with two hidden layers, ReLU activations, and softmax output.

Evaluation: Test accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix for performance assessment.

This workflow ensures clean data, effective feature representation, and interpretable model evaluation.
